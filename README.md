# Calculator-Project
This calculator uses basic calculation functions in javascript for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
Each button has an onclick event listener that calls the function when clicked.
The AC button clears everything in the display.
The CE button clears the last value in the display.
The dot function is supposed to add a dot in the display. The function should not add a dot twice to an array, unless the last value in the display is an operator
The percentage function should add a % after a number and when evaluated provide the percent, for example 8%==0.08. Unfortunately the function is not evaluated by the javascript eval function and thus does not work for the moment.
